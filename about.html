        <h2>Karen</h2>
        <h3>Owner</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Karen Casey, <a href="http://www.ccpdt.org/">CPDT-KA</a>, owner of
        Paw To Hoof Pet Services. I have been in the pet service business since 2002 caring for dogs,
        cats, horses, small farm animals, and pockets pets. Throughout my many years in the
        pet service business, I have continued to grow my experience and education in the
        many facets of training dogs and horses. My degree in Horse Management, with a
        focus on training, from The Ohio State University and my Professional
        Dog Training Certification &#8211 Knowledge Assessed from the Council of
        Certified Professional Dog Trainers has allowed me to help owners better
        understand their pets and recommend ways to resolve or manage issues.
        I continue to enjoy attending horse training clinics and dog training seminars,
        in my spare time, to stay current and further my animal training education.

        Currently, my husband and I enjoy living with our amazing, Canine Good Citizen Certified dog,
        Boo, and our senior cat, Odie. My pets are my kids and I understand the concerns pet owners
        face when they need to leave their pet behind. I treat my clients pets like they are my own
        with a lot of love, care, and attention. Having a horse and dog educational background as well
        as years of hands on experience has made me a qualified and well rounded pet service
        provider for your four-legged kids. I hope to meet you and your fur-kids soon!

      <h2>Brenda</h2>
      <h3>Dog Walker, Horse and Small Farm Animal Guru</h3>
      <p>My name is Brenda Barton, and I have always been a huge animals-of-all-kinds lover
      and have lived on a farm for the last 25 years.  During that time I have owned and
      cared for all manner of critters including dogs, of course, cats, sheep, llamas, goats,
      and beef cows.  I have owned and enjoyed horses since 1991, having at least two and as
      many as four at any given time; my husband and I currently live with three on our
      small farm in Duvall, along with our one dog, two cats, pigs, chickens, ducks and
      guinea fowl.  Since the early 90's I have been interested in <q>Natural Horsemanship</q>
      and am an avid student of the horse and the principles of developing my horses to
      be willing partners.  I have also participated in many workshops, covering
      everything from saddle fitting, to horse massage, hoof care, nutrition and
      various alternative modalities, as well as an 7-week
      Equine Assisted Learning program.  I believe animals can be an important addition
      to our quality of life, and it&#8217s important to me to provide a happy, healthy,
      balanced life for them.
