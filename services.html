      <h2>Roof Installation</h2>
        <p>We do all types and styles of residential and commercial roof installation.
           We do flat roofing, low pitch and high pitch with all of the available materials from
           cedar shakes to the latest membrane roofing.  Our services include new construction
           roofing and full tear-off and re-roof jobs.  We insure that all trees and landscaping

      <h2>Roof Repair</h2>
        <p>A leaking roof is something that you never want to think about,
           but when the need arises you need to know a quality roofer is available.
           We've been doing roof repairs since we first opened our doors.
           We repair both commercial and residential roofs and are available at a
           moment's notice. We understand that you can't afford to wait two weeks
           to get a roof repair done.

        <h2>Roof Maintenance</h2>
          <p>The roof is the most under appreciated structures on a home.
            No one thinks about their roof till they have a leak or a big
            wind storm rolls through.  We check the integrity of your asphalt
            shingles for loss of coating, roof flashing for rust and exhaust
            vents for signs of clogging. A single clogged exhaust vent can
            cause your energy bills to skyrocket in the summer time as your
            attic over heats making your cooling system work over time.
            Hire us before you have to put buckets out or crank the air conditioning.
