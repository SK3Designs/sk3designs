        <p>Paw To Hoof Pet Services is unique from other pet service companies in that we are
        qualified and experienced in training dogs and horses. We work with dogs of all ages
        from puppies to seniors, on issues from learning basic commands to those hard to
        handle problems. Horse training services range from ground work basics to riding work.</p>

        <p>As dog and horse owners know, every animal is a unique individual. Therefore,
        training programs will vary as well as the amount of time needed to learn a
        new skill or modify a behavior. In order to give you the highest quality service,
        we ask that you call us with your training or behavioral needs so that we
        can best determine how to proceed together.</p>

           pillow/bed, as well as any skills that you would like your puppy to practice
           while we visit. This program not only provides exercise, play and learning but
           we also incorporate socialization field trips to help your puppy grow up to be
           comfortable in all of his/her environments. Our goal is to help your puppy
           become a balanced, happy, and polite canine citizen. We visit once or twice
           a day for 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

        <p>While you are away, you can feel confident that your dog is getting

				<h2>Karen</h2>
        <h3>Owner</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Karen Casey, <a href="http://www.ccpdt.org/">CPDT-KA</a>, owner of
        Paw To Hoof Pet Services. I have been in the pet service business since 2002 caring for dogs,
        cats, horses, small farm animals, and pockets pets. Throughout my many years in the
        pet service business, I have continued to grow my experience and education in the
        many facets of training dogs and horses. My degree in Horse Management, with a
        focus on training, from The Ohio State University and my Professional
        Dog Training Certification &#8211 Knowledge Assessed from the Council of
        Certified Professional Dog Trainers has allowed me to help owners better
        understand their pets and recommend ways to resolve or manage issues.
        I continue to enjoy attending horse training clinics and dog training seminars,
        in my spare time, to stay current and further my animal training education.

        Currently, my husband and I enjoy living with our amazing, Canine Good Citizen Certified dog,
        Boo, and our senior cat, Odie. My pets are my kids and I understand the concerns pet owners
        face when they need to leave their pet behind. I treat my clients pets like they are my own
        with a lot of love, care, and attention. Having a horse and dog educational background as well
        as years of hands on experience has made me a qualified and well rounded pet service
        provider for your four-legged kids. I hope to meet you and your fur-kids soon!

					<h2>Brenda</h2>
		      <h3>Dog Walker, Horse and Small Farm Animal Guru</h3>
		      <p>My name is Brenda Barton, and I have always been a huge animals-of-all-kinds lover
		      and have lived on a farm for the last 25 years.  During that time I have owned and
		      cared for all manner of critters including dogs, of course, cats, sheep, llamas, goats,
		      and beef cows.  I have owned and enjoyed horses since 1991, having at least two and as
		      many as four at any given time; my husband and I currently live with three on our
		      small farm in Duvall, along with our one dog, two cats, pigs, chickens, ducks and
		      guinea fowl.  Since the early 90's I have been interested in <q>Natural Horsemanship</q>
		      and am an avid student of the horse and the principles of developing my horses to
		      be willing partners.  I have also participated in many workshops, covering
		      everything from saddle fitting, to horse massage, hoof care, nutrition and
		      various alternative modalities, as well as an 7-week
		      Equine Assisted Learning program.  I believe animals can be an important addition

		      <p>My name is Nadia Tufnell, and working with animals is my passion!
		      I have a degree in Animal Behavior and have been providing pet care
		      services for many years.  I am currently a cat care specialist
		      volunteer for the Northwest Organization for Animal Help (NOAH)
		      and have volunteered with the Everett Animal Shelter.
		      I have experience with farm animals from working on a
		      horse farm for a year, interning at Farm Sanctuary&#8217s
		      Animal Acres, and volunteering at Pasado&#8217s Safe Haven.
		      I have also volunteered at Sarvey Wildlife Care, helping to
		      rehabilitate wild animals. I currently have two cats named Popoki and Dixie.
